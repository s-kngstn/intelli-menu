# To Do

Top right buttons on individual restaurant table page allows you to add menu and delete menu
Go to invdividual restaurants page and use the folder in the row to open the menu
Inside the menu is the list of menu items (another table) in which you can modify and add menu items and specify the allergies/diet

## YOU NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF DOCUMENTING AND COMMENTING YOUR CODE, EVERYTHING YOU DO WRITE WHY YOURE DOING IT AND WHAT ITS INTENT IS SO U UNDERSTAND NEXT TIME U READ IT

0. API ROUTES IN PRODUCTION SHOULD MAKE THE CALL TO VERCEL LINK AND NOT LOCALHOST ✅
1. menuItem form should have course be a select form input that contains the values [starter, main, sides, dessert] - Edit Form ✅
2. MAKE YOUR DATA SEED LARGER, SO YOU HAVE MORE MENU ITEMS TO WORK WITH ON THE YOUR-MENUS/[ID] PAGE!!!!!
3. qr code should link to a page (your-menu/[id]) that generates a menu for users to look at this a filtering system above it. - UI/Component
4. still need to finish crush on restaurants, menu, and menu items (add, delete, edit, patch) -- APIs
5. need to have some modals to confirm delete add edit etc...- UI/Component
6. protect more page routes to restrict un authorized users.

## I would like to add

1. Analysis for the restaurant (which restaurants have the most of a certain option.. show graphs)

## TESTING

1. Jest for unit testing.
2. Cypress for end-to-end.
