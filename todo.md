# To Do

Top right buttons on individual restaurant table page allows you to add menu and delete menu
Go to invdividual restaurants page and use the folder in the row to open the menu
Inside the menu is the list of menu items (another table) in which you can modify and add menu items and specify the allergies/diet

1. create a form for the menu items edit page and have the allergies be prechecked if true so user can uncheck and turn to false
2. be able to add a menu item to the menu, with a form that lets you check the alleriges and diets
3. the menu items page should have a QR code that links to an outside link with the menu and filtering system
