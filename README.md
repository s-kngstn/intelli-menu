# Intellimenu Documentation WIP

## Description

IntelliMenu allows restaurant businesses to provide dynamic, smart menu solutions for their respective clients by using a cutting edge filtering system that abstracts menu items away from their clients based on dietary preferences and allergies.

## Core Libraries/Frameworks

Nextjs (Fullstack React/Node framework)
TypeScript (Typed Javascript)
ChakraUI (UI Component Library)
Prisma (Database ORM)

## Setup for Development

1) Clone this repository
2) Install npm packages using the terminal command $npm install
3) Connect your prisma ORM to your machine locally or a cloud platform (I am currently using Heroku)
4) It's recommended if you are using Prisma on VS Code to use their native plug in for syntax highlighting, formatting and autocomplete
