              Many restaurants have yet to provide allergen and dietary
              information on their menus, and when they do often the menu
              becomes hard to read, ugly and over crowded with extra information
              that can lead to information fatigue. Menuâ€™s that are easy to read
              should display the name of the dish, a small description and the
              price only.

              Sometimes clients avoid going out to eat due to being embarrassed
              about sharing their allergies, or just tired of having to repeat
              the same long process of: Informing the waiter of their allergies,
              Having the waiter go to the chef and explain the situation, Then
              returning to the table and hopefully conveying the correct
              information.

              During weekends and peak hours of operation, these extra steps are
              almost certain to guarantee long wait times for all guests, which
              in turn, lessens the experience.

              There are times someone might be going on a date, or having an
              important business meeting and would rather not have to explain in
              public that they do not like onions, or cannot eat fish, or they
              have a peanut allergy.. Intellimenu provides a safe space for
